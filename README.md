# WhetherApp
This weather app project demonstrates how to build a dynamic web application using JAVA,JSP, Servlets, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It involves capturing user input, processing data on the server, and rendering dynamic content on the client side. This project helps in understanding the integration of front-end and back-end technologies in a real-world application.</br>
Creating a weather app using JSP (JavaServer Pages), Java Servlets, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves developing a web application that allows users to get weather information for a specific city. </br>
Components 
1] Front-End:-</br>
HTML: Structure of the web pages.</br>
CSS: Styling for the user interface.</br>
JavaScript: Handling client-side logic and interactions.</br>
2] Back-End:-
Java Servlets: Handle HTTP requests and responses, interact with the OpenWeather API, and forward data to JSP.</br>
JSP: Dynamically generate HTML content based on data received from the servlets.</br>
How It Works</br>
1] User Interface:-</br>
The user enters a city name into a search input field and submits the form.</br>
The form sends a POST request to a Java servlet (MyServlet).</br>
2] Servlet Processing:-</br>
The servlet retrieves the city name from the request.
It makes a request to the OpenWeather API to get the weather data for the specified city.
The servlet processes the API response and forwards the data to a JSP page.
3] JSP Rendering:-
The JSP page dynamically generates the HTML to display the weather information based on the data provided by the servlet.
